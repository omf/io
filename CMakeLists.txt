# Base Io build system

# This file is the top level CMakeLists.txt and all the items defined in this

# This is an experimental build system, and it should be treated as such. It
# is being developed on a Mac OS X system, and tested as well on a FreeBSD
# system. I have no access to other platforms to test there. If this notice
# goes away, then it can be said that this system works on at least three
# major platforms:
#   1. Mac OS X
#   2. Linux
#   3. Windows
#
# If you find a bug for a particular platform, please feel free to fix it, or
# contact the iolanguage mailing list, file a bug report, or contact Jeremy
# Tregunna directly, at the e-mail address above. Please follow that order.

# Require CMake 2.8. I know for sure that this will not work with CMake 2.6
# due to the use of the FILE command we use when creating the bundle
# hierarchy.
